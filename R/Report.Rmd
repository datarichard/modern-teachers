# Abstract  

The mental health and wellbeing of various professions is an important predictor of economic outcomes, workforce retention as well as a broader indicator of our socioeconomic priorities. Recent changes and challenges to the nature of professional work in Australia, including shifting employee expectations, such as lockdowns and the rise of remote work due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted the connection between psychosocial job characteristics and mental health. Here we describe the connection between mental health and job demands, job control and job security, and how it has changed in the past 20 years in Australia using annual nationally representative survey results from HILDA.  

<br><br>

# Methods  

<br>

## Variable definitions  

<br>

### Professional codes

Professions were defined by the ISC 4-digit codes (i.e., `jbm688`) available in the restricted HILDA dataset, based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations ([ANZSCO 2006](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/E3031B89999B4582CA2575DF002DA702?opendocument)).  

<br>

### Remoteness  

The Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA+) is provided in HILDA (`hhsra`) and based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard Remoteness Area framework [@summerfield2021hilda]. We defined the remoteness of the region of each teacher and collapsed the three most remote categories into a single category to produce three levels of remoteness: Major Cities, Inner Regional and Other (*Outer regional, remote and very remote*).   

<br>

### Psychosocial characteristics of work  

The psychosocial characteristics of work as defined by @butterworth2010deriving, included three psychosocial job components (factors) from 12 items in all waves as well as an additional nine items available from Wave 5 (2005). We used all available items in each wave and constructed scores for each component by calculating the average of item responses (after reverse scoring the negatively worded items). Each component and the corresponding items are shown below. Item scores range from 1 to 7.   

<br>

#### Job demands & complexity

| code  | description | waves |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- |
| `jomms` | My job is more stressful than I had ever imagined | all waves |
| `jompi` | I fear that the amount of stress in my job will make me ill | all waves |
| `jomcd` | My job is complex and difficult | all waves |
| `jomns` | My job often required me to learn new skills | all waves |
| `jomus` | I use my skills in current job | all waves |
| `jomini`| My job requires me to take initiative | 5:20 |
| `jomfast` | I have to work fast in my job | 5:20 |
| `jomwi` | I have to work very intensely in my job | 5:20 |
| `jomtime` | I don’t have enough time to do everything in my job | 5:20 |

  
#### Job control  


| code  | description | waves |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- |
|`jomfd`| I have freedom to decide how I do my own work | all waves |
|`jomls`| I have a lot of say about what happens in my job | all waves |
|`jomfw`| I have freedom to decide when I do my work | all waves |
|`jomdw`| I have a lot of choice in deciding what I do at work | 5:20 |
|`jomflex`| My working times can be flexible | 5:20 |
|`jombrk`| I can decide when to take a break | 5:20 |
|`jomrpt`| My job requires me to do the same things over and over again | 5:20 |
| `jomvar`| My job provides me with a variety of interesting things to do | 5:20 |


#### Job security

| code  | description | waves |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- |
|`jompf`| I get paid fairly for the things I do in my job | all waves |
|`jomsf`| I have a secure future in my job | all waves |
|`jomcsb`| Company I work for will still be in business in 5 years | all waves |
|`jomwf`| I worry about the future of my job | all waves |

## Mental health  

Mental health was measured by the MHi-5 score (0-100) and compared to life-satisfaction responses (multiplied by 10 to match 0-100 range).  

<br>

  se = sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))
  
  out <- data.frame(
    ymin = m - se,
    y = m,
    ymax = m + se
  )
  
  return(out)
  
}

```


<br>

<br>

## Psychosocial characteristics of work  

Job demands, job control and job security components were calculated from the averages of the items in each respective table (shown above).    

<br>

```{r figure_2, fig.dim=c(9,9)}

         outcome = str_to_title(outcome)) %>%

    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey95", color = "white"),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "white"))
```

<br>

<br>

## Job strain  

Job strain represents the co-occurrence of high job demands and low job control. Thresholds for high and low scores were determined by quartile of each component in the entire employed sample of HILDA (all twenty waves). Thus a common threshold value was used for all professions.  

The universal threshold for low job control was a score < 3.25, and the universal threshold for high job demand was a score > 4.55.  

<br>

##### Figure 3. The proportion of professionals suffering job strain over time
```{r figure_3, fig.dim=c(9,6)}
ctrl_t <- 3.25 # with(read_rds("../data/occupations.rds"), summary(job_control))
dmnd_t <- 4.556 # with(read_rds("../data/occupations.rds"), summary(job_demand))

df <- occupations %>%
  # select(xwaveid, year, ghmh, job_control, job_demand, job_security) %>%
  mutate(
    job_strain = case_when(
      job_control < ctrl_t & job_demand > dmnd_t ~ "Job strain",
      job_control < ctrl_t ~ "Low control",
      job_demand > dmnd_t ~ "High demand",
      TRUE ~ "Low strain"),
    job_strain = fct_relevel(job_strain, "Job strain")
  )

  percent(profession, year, job_strain) %>%

# Model results  

We modelled mental health (MHi-5 scores) as a function of time ($f(year)$) to determine whether the mental health trend was decreasing for each profession. We also tested whether trends in psychosocial job components ($f(job \ demands) + f(job \ control) + f(job \ security)$) explained the trends in mental health. Predicted mental health trends were compared before and after adding the psychosocial job trends as explanatory variables. Any changes in the mental health trend after adding the explanatory variables represent the residual trend once the psychosocial job trends are accounted for, and thus indicates their impact on changes in mental health over the period.    

Models regressing mental health (MHi-5 scores) in each profession onto each psychosocial job component (job demand, job control, job security) were estimated, using non-linear, smooth interaction terms representing the temporal trend of each component in a generalized additive model (GAM):  

$$
\text{MHi-5}_{it} \sim \beta_0 + f(\text{year}_t) + f(\text{year}_t, \ \text{job control}_{it}) + \epsilon
$$  

$$
\text{MHi-5}_{it} \sim \beta_0 + f(\text{year}_t) + f(\text{year}_t, \ \text{job demand}_{it}) + \epsilon
$$  

$$
\text{MHi-5}_{it} \sim \beta_0 + f(\text{year}_t) + f(\text{year}_t, \ \text{job security}_{it}) + \epsilon
$$  


Where $i$ is the individual and $t$ is the year, and each smooth term $f$ represents the temporal interaction between each job component and time.

<br>

<br>

The importance of each psychosocial job component was estimated in a model regressing mental health (MHi-5 scores) on the three psychosocial job components (job demand, job control, job security) using non-linear interaction terms in a generalized additive model (GAM):   

$$
\text{MHi-5}_{it} \sim \beta_0 + f_0(\text{year}) + f_1(\text{year}_t, \ \text{job demand}_{it}) + f_2(\text{year}_t, \ \text{job control}_{it}) + f_3(\text{year}_t, \ \text{job security}_{it}) + \epsilon
$$

Where $i$ is the individual and $t$ is the year, and each smooth term $f$ represents the temporal interaction between each job component and time.  

The resulting smooths for each component represent the conditional importance of each for mental health over time.
